"""
Test suite for phone number validation in the User entity.

This module verifies that the User class correctly validates the 'phone' field
according to the E.164 international format standard. The phone number is optional,
but if provided, it must conform to strict syntax rules.

Validation rules:
- Must be None (allowed) or a string in E.164 format (e.g., '+33142948800')
- Must start with '+'
- First digit after '+' must be 1â€“9 (not zero)
- Maximum of 15 digits total (1 + up to 14 digits)
- No spaces, hyphens, parentheses, or other formatting characters

The tests use create_valid_user() from test helpers to minimize boilerplate.
Aligned with DDD (fail-fast) and TDD principles.
