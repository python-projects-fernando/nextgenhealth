"""
Specification that validates whether a given value is a valid phone number in E.164 format.

A valid phone number must:
- Be None (as the field is optional) or a string
- If provided, start with '+' followed by the country code and subscriber number
- Contain only digits after the '+'
- Have a total length of 1 to 15 digits (after '+')
- Begin with a digit from 1â€“9 (e.g., +1 for US, +44 for UK)

This rule ensures global interoperability with communication systems such as SMS gateways,
voice services, and emergency contact routing in healthcare applications.
