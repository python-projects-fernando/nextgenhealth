    Base exception raised when a User violates identity or business rules.

    Serves as the parent class for all user-related validation errors.
    Helps enable broad exception handling at higher layers while preserving specificity.

    Examples:
        - Invalid UUID format
        - Malformed email address
        - Name containing invalid characters
        - Date of birth in the future
    """

class InvalidUUIDError(InvalidUserError):
    """
    Raised when the provided UUID is not a valid UUID instance.

    This includes:
        - None
        - Empty string
        - Malformed string (e.g., 'not-a-uuid')
        - Wrong type (e.g., int, dict, list)

    The User entity requires a valid UUID object for identity integrity and auditability.
    """

class InvalidEmailError(InvalidUserError):
    """
    Raised when an email does not conform to RFC-like formatting rules.

    Valid emails must:
        - Be a non-empty string
        - Contain exactly one '@'
        - Have valid local-part and domain structure

    Example invalid values: 'invalid-email', 'user@', '@domain.com'
    """

class InvalidNameError(InvalidUserError):

    Raised when first_name or last_name contains invalid characters.

    Names must:
        - Be non-empty strings
        - Contain only alphabetic characters (A-Z, a-z) and single spaces
        - Not include numbers, symbols, accents, or consecutive spaces

    Ensures consistency and compliance in personal data representation.
    """

    Raised when phone number is provided but not in E.164 format.

    Valid format: '+' followed by 1â€“15 digits (e.g., '+1234567890').

    Example invalid values:
        - '123-456-7890' (formatted)
        - '1234567890' (missing +)
        - '+12' (too short)

    Aligns with international telephony standards for global systems.

class InvalidDateOfBirthError(InvalidUserError):

    Raised when date of birth is in the future or unrealistically far in the past.

    Business rule: date of birth must be:
        - A valid date object
        - Not in the future
        - Not before 1900 (or configurable minimum)

    Example violations: born in 2050 or 1800.

        - Be a timezone-aware datetime object
        - Use UTC timezone
        - Not be in the future
