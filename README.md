# NextGenHealth

> **Next-Generation Healthcare Management System**  
> *Secure, scalable, and role-based ‚Äî built with Clean Architecture and Python.*

NextGenHealth is a healthcare management system designed to streamline patient care, appointment scheduling, medical record access, and administrative workflows for clinics and hospitals. The system follows **Clean Architecture** and **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles to ensure scalability, maintainability, and compliance with regulations such as HIPAA and LGPD.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system is structured using **Clean Architecture**, ensuring separation of concerns and testability:

| Layer | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| **Domain** | Core business entities and domain rules (`User`, `Appointment`, `MedicalRecord`) |
| **Application** | Business logic orchestrators (Use Cases) and service interfaces |
| **Interface Adapter** | REST API endpoints (Django REST Framework / Flask), controllers |
| **Infrastructure** | Database (PostgreSQL), notification services, audit logging |

This design ensures the core business logic remains independent of frameworks and databases.
