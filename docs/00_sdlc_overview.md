# SDLC Overview for NextGenHealth

This document outlines the initial stages of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the **NextGenHealth** system, a healthcare management project.

---

## 1. Project Scope Definition

- **Main Objective:** Create a healthcare management system that facilitates the management of patients, appointments, exams, medical records, and reports.
- **Target Audience:** Clinics, hospitals, doctors, and healthcare professionals.
- **Key Features (high-level):**
  - Patient registration.
  - Appointment scheduling.
  - Electronic medical records management.
  - Exam and result recording.
  - Report and statistics generation.
  - Authentication and access control (doctors, nurses, administrators).

---

## 2. Requirements Gathering

### Functional Requirements:
- The system must allow patient registration with information such as name, date of birth, address, phone number, email and national ID, etc.
- It should be possible to schedule appointments, associating patients, doctors, date, and time.
- Doctors should be able to access and update electronic medical records.
- The system must generate reports of completed appointments, requested exams, etc.

### Non-Functional Requirements:
- The system must be secure, with authentication and encryption of sensitive data.
- It should be scalable to support a large number of users.
- The interface must be intuitive and responsive (work well on mobile and desktop devices).

---

## 3. Feasibility Analysis

- **Technical:** Verify if you have the necessary skills to implement the project (Python, databases, frameworks, etc.).
- **Financial:** As this is a personal project, the cost will be low, but consider free or low-cost tools (e.g., SQLite for the initial database).
- **Operational:** Think about how the system will be used daily by end-users.

## 4. Project Planning

### Tools and Technologies:
- Language: Python.
- Framework: Django or Flask (for web development).
- Database: PostgreSQL or MySQL (for production) or SQLite (for initial development).
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or a framework like Bootstrap).
- Version Control: Git (with a repository on GitHub or Azure DevOps).

### Timeline:
- Divide the project into phases (e.g., Phase 1 - Patient Registration, Phase 2 - Appointment Scheduling, etc.).
- Estimate the time for each phase (e.g., 2 weeks for Phase 1).

### Methodology:
- Use an agile methodology, such as Scrum or Kanban, to manage tasks and sprints.

---

## 5. System Architecture Design

### System Architecture:
- Frontend: User interface (web pages).
- Backend: Business logic and database integration.
- Database: Data storage (patients, appointments, etc.).

### Diagrams:
- Create a use case diagram to represent user interactions with the system.
- Draw a class diagram to model system entities (Patient, Doctor, Appointment, etc.).
- Create a database diagram to model tables and relationships.

---

## 6. Initial Documentation

### Vision Document:
- Describe the system's purpose, the problems it solves, and its main features.

### Product Backlog:
- List all the features the system should have, prioritizing the most important ones.

### Test Plan:
- Define how you will test the system (unit tests, integration tests, etc.).

---

## 7. Next Steps

### Development Phase:
- Start by implementing the basic project structure (environment setup, database creation, etc.).
- Implement features one by one, following the backlog.

### Testing Phase:
- Test each feature as it is implemented.

### Deployment Phase:
- Deploy the system to a production environment (e.g., Heroku, AWS, Azure).

## Example Initial Backlog

1. **Patient Registration:**
   - Create a registration form.
   - Validate input data.
   - Save data to the database.

2. **Appointment Scheduling:**
   - Create a scheduling interface.
   - Validate time conflicts.
   - Associate appointments with patients and doctors.

3. **Authentication and Access Control:**
   - Implement login and logout.
   - Define access levels (doctor, administrator, etc.).
