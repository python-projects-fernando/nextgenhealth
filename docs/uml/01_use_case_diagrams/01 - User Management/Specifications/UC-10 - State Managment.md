# Use Case Specification: **State Management**  

## 1. Overview  

This document specifies the **"State Management"** use case for the **NextGenHealth** system. The purpose of this use case is to allow administrators to create, update, view, and delete states/regions in the system, ensuring that address management remains consistent and accurate.

## 2. Use Case Details  

### 2.1 Use Case ID  
**UC-10**: State Management  

### 2.2 Actors  
- **Primary Actor**: Administrator  
- **Secondary Actor**: System (responsible for storing and retrieving state data)  

### 2.3 Preconditions  
- The user must be authenticated and have administrator privileges.  
- The system must be operational and capable of storing and retrieving state/region information.  
- A state/region must always be associated with an existing country.  

### 2.4 Postconditions  
- The system updates the list of states/regions to reflect any changes made by the administrator.  
- The state/region details are correctly stored, updated, or deleted in the system.  

### 2.5 Trigger  
- The administrator accesses the state management interface and initiates an action (create, update, or delete a state/region).

## 3. Basic Flow (Main Success Scenario)  

### **Creating a New State/Region:**  
1. The administrator selects the "Create State" option in the system.  
2. The administrator enters the necessary information for the new state/region, including:  
   - State/region name  
   - State code (optional)  
   - Associated country  
3. The system validates the entered data (e.g., checks if the state already exists within the same country).  
4. The system stores the new state/region details in the database.  
5. The system confirms the successful creation of the state/region.  

### **Updating an Existing State/Region:**  
1. The administrator selects the "Update State" option in the system.  
2. The administrator chooses an existing state/region from the list.  
3. The administrator modifies the necessary data.  
4. The system validates the changes to prevent inconsistencies.  
5. The system updates the state/region information in the database.  
6. The system confirms the successful update.  

### **Deleting an Existing State/Region:**  
1. The administrator selects the "Delete State" option in the system.  
2. The administrator chooses an existing state/region from the list.  
3. The system checks for dependencies (e.g., addresses registered under this state).  
4. If there are no dependencies, the system deletes the state/region from the database.  
5. The system confirms the successful deletion.  
6. If dependencies exist, the system alerts the administrator and provides options to cancel the deletion or manage the dependent data.  

### **Viewing State/Region Information:**  
1. The administrator selects the "View State" option in the system.  
2. The administrator can search for states/regions by name, country, or other identifiers.  
3. The system retrieves and displays the state/region information.  

---

### Alternative Flow:  
- If the state/region already exists for the same country during creation, the system displays an error message indicating that the creation cannot proceed.  
- If the administrator attempts to delete a state/region associated with existing addresses, the system displays a warning and prevents deletion until dependent data is resolved.  
- If the administrator lacks permission to manage states/regions, the system denies access and displays an error message.  

---

## 4. Special Requirements  

- **Access Control:** Only administrators can manage states/regions.  
- **Data Validation:** The system must validate duplicate names within the same country and ensure that each state/region is linked to an existing country.  
- **Error Handling:** The system must provide clear error messages for invalid inputs, action failures (such as database errors), and permission issues.  

---

## 5. Exceptions  

- If the system fails to create, update, or delete a state/region due to a database failure, it should notify the administrator of the error and allow retrying the operation.  
- If an administrator attempts to delete a state/region linked to existing addresses, the system prevents deletion until the dependent data is resolved.  

---


## 6. Assumptions  

- The administrator has the proper training and permissions to manage states/regions.  
- The system has a database capable of storing state/region information.  
- States/regions are always linked to a valid, existing country in the system.  

---

## 7. Notes  

- The system should allow efficient searching of states/regions, with filtering options by country and name.  
- State/region data should be stored with backup and recovery mechanisms to prevent data loss.  
- States/regions may be used in multiple system functionalities, such as address management and patient location.
