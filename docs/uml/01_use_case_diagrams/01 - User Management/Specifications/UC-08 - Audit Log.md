# Use Case Specification: **Audit Log**  

## 1. Overview  

This document specifies the **"Audit Log"** use case for the **NextGenHealth** system. The purpose of this use case is to maintain a record of critical actions performed by users in the system, ensuring traceability, compliance, and security.  

---

## 2. Use Case Details  

### 2.1 Use Case ID  
**UC-08**: Audit Log  

### 2.2 Actors  
- **Primary Actor**: System (automatically logs actions)  
- **Secondary Actor**: Administrator (views audit logs for monitoring and compliance)  

### 2.3 Preconditions  
- The system must be running and operational.  
- User actions that require logging (e.g., updates, deletions, role changes, login attempts) must be predefined in the system.  
- Only administrators can access and view the audit logs.  

### 2.4 Postconditions  
- The system successfully logs the relevant user action.  
- The log entry includes details such as user ID, action performed, timestamp, and affected data.  
- Administrators can retrieve and review audit logs for security and compliance purposes.  

### 2.5 Trigger  
- A user performs a system action that requires logging (e.g., updating a profile, deleting a record, modifying permissions).  
- An administrator queries the audit logs for review.

## 3. Basic Flow (Main Success Scenario)  

### **Logging an Action (System-Driven):**  
1. A user performs an action in the system (e.g., updating information, assigning roles, deleting a record).  
2. The system detects the action and determines if it needs to be logged.  
3. If the action requires logging, the system records the event in the audit log, including:  
   - User ID  
   - Timestamp  
   - Action performed  
   - Affected data  
   - Status (success/failure)  
4. The log entry is stored in the audit log database.  

### **Viewing the Audit Log (Administrator Only):**  
1. The administrator accesses the audit log interface in the system.  
2. The administrator applies filters (e.g., date range, user ID, action type) to retrieve specific log entries.  
3. The system retrieves and displays the filtered audit log records.  
4. The administrator reviews the logs and may take further actions if necessary.  

---

### Alternative Flow:  
- If an action fails to log due to system errors, the system retries logging the event or generates an internal alert for administrators.  
- If the administrator does not have sufficient permissions to access the logs, the system denies access.  
- If no logs match the applied filters, the system informs the administrator that no records were found.  

---

## 4. Special Requirements  

- **Access Control:** Only administrators can access audit logs.  
- **Data Security:** Audit logs must be stored securely to prevent unauthorized modifications.  
- **Retention Policy:** Logs should be retained for a predefined period based on compliance requirements.  
- **Export and Reporting:** Administrators should be able to export logs for external auditing and compliance reporting.  

---

## 5. Exceptions  

- If the system is unable to store an audit log entry due to a database failure, it should retry and notify system administrators.  
- If an unauthorized user attempts to access audit logs, access is denied, and an additional log entry is created for security monitoring.  
- If logs are excessively large, pagination or filtering should be enforced for performance optimization.  

---

## 6. Relationships  

- **Include:**  
  - The **"Audit Log"** use case may include a **"Search Log Entries"** functionality to filter and retrieve specific log records efficiently.  

---

## 7. Assumptions  

- The system correctly identifies actions that require logging.  
- Administrators have the necessary training and permissions to access and interpret audit logs.  

---

## 8. Notes  

- The system should provide a user-friendly interface for administrators to review logs with search and filtering capabilities.  
- Audit log entries should be immutable to maintain integrity.  
- The system should allow integration with external security and compliance monitoring tools.
