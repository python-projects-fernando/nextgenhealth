## Main Success Scenario (Basic Flow)

| Step | Actor | System |
|------|-------|--------|
| 1 | â€” | Displays registration form (web interface). |
| 2 | User (Patient or Admin) | Enters required information: full name, date of birth, gender, email, phone number, address (street, city, state, postal code). |
| 3 | User | Optionally enters: national ID, emergency contact, insurance information, preferred language. |
| 4 | User | Submits the form. |
| 5 | System | Validates email format. |
| 6 | System | Checks for duplicate registration using email address. |
| 7 | System | If validation passes, generates a unique UUID for the patient. |
| 8 | System | Hashes password (if self-registration) using secure algorithm (e.g., bcrypt). |
| 9 | System | Stores patient data in the database. |
| 10 | System | Assigns default role: **Patient** (if self-registration) or specified role (if registered by admin). |
| 11 | System | Logs the registration event in the audit trail (who, when, how). |
| 12 | System | Displays success message: "Registration completed successfully." |
| 13 | System | (Optional) Sends welcome email with login instructions. |

## Alternative Flows

### **A1 â€“ Invalid Email or Phone Format**
- **Trigger**: Step 5 â€“ Invalid format detected.
- **Steps**:
  1. System displays error: "Please enter a valid email address and phone number."
  2. Returns to Step 2.
- **Resume**: User corrects data and resubmits.

### **A2 â€“ Duplicate Email Detected**
- **Trigger**: Step 6 â€“ Email already exists in the system.
- **Steps**:
  1. System displays message: "A patient with this email already exists. Please log in or contact support."
  2. Offers link to **Login** or **Forgot Password**.
- **End**: Registration aborted.

### **A3 â€“ Missing Required Fields**
- **Trigger**: Step 4 â€“ Required fields are empty.
- **Steps**:
  1. System highlights missing fields.
  2. Displays message: "All marked fields are required."
  3. Returns to form.
- **Resume**: User fills missing data and resubmits.

### **A4 â€“ Administrator Registers on Behalf of Patient**
- **Trigger**: Actor is Administrator.
- **Modification**:
  - Step 2: Admin fills all fields, including optional ones.
  - Step 8: No password set (or temporary password sent via secure channel).
  - Step 10: System may mark patient as "pending onboarding."
  - Step 13: Sends email with temporary credentials (if applicable).

## Exception Flows

### **E1 â€“ Database Unavailable**
- **Trigger**: Step 9 â€“ Database connection fails.
- **Steps**:
  1. System logs error.
  2. Displays message: "Registration could not be completed. Please try again later."
  3. Data is not saved.
- **End**: Process aborted. Admin notified (if in production).

### **E2 â€“ Audit Log Failure**
- **Trigger**: Step 11 â€“ Audit service is down.
- **Steps**:
  1. System logs error locally.
  2. Proceeds with registration (but flags for recovery).
  3. Alert sent to system administrator.
- **Note**: Audit failure does **not** block registration, but must be resolved.

## Business Rules
- **BR-PAT-01**: Email address must be unique across all patients.
- **BR-PAT-02**: Password must be at least 8 characters long, contain a number and a special character.
- **BR-PAT-03**: UUID is immutable and never exposed to end users directly.
- **BR-PAT-04**: Only administrators can register staff members (doctors, nurses).
- **BR-AUTH-01**: All credentials must be stored using one-way encryption (bcrypt or equivalent).

## Notes and Open Issues
- âœ… Future enhancement: Allow registration via social login (e.g., Google) â€” out of scope for now.
- ðŸ”’ GDPR/HIPAA: Patient has right to access, correct, and export data (REQ-DATA-004, REQ-DATA-006).
- ðŸ“± Responsive design required for mobile registration.
