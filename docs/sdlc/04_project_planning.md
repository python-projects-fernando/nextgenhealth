# 4. Project Planning for NextGenHealth

This document outlines the comprehensive project plan for the NextGenHealth system based on the feasibility analysis results from [Feasibility Analysis](./03_feasibility_analysis.md). It defines the development methodology, timeline, resource allocation, technology stack, and risk management strategy.

## 4.1 Executive Summary

The NextGenHealth project will be developed using Agile Scrum methodology over a 6-month timeline with 4 distinct phases. The project leverages a Python/Django/Flask technology stack with Clean Architecture principles to ensure scalability and maintainability. A security-first approach will be implemented to meet healthcare compliance requirements (HIPAA/GDPR).
