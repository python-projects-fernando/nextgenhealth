# System Architecture for NextGenHealth

This document describes the architecture of the **NextGenHealth** system, following the principles of **Clean Architecture** with elements of **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**. This approach ensures scalability, maintainability, and testability while keeping the domain logic independent of external frameworks.

---

## 1. Overview

The **NextGenHealth** system is structured using **Clean Architecture**, which separates concerns into distinct layers and keeps the core business logic isolated from infrastructure and external dependencies.

### Architectural Layers:
1. **Entities (Domain Layer - Core Business Logic)**
   - Contains business rules and domain models.
   - Independent of external frameworks and databases.
   - Uses **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles for modeling key entities (e.g., `Patient`, `Appointment`, `MedicalRecord`).
   
2. **Use Cases (Application Layer - Business Rules)**
   - Defines application-specific business logic (e.g., scheduling an appointment, retrieving medical records).
   - Uses services and repositories to interact with domain entities.

3. **Interface Adapters (Presentation & API Layer)**
   - Provides RESTful APIs and user interfaces.
   - Adapts data from the application layer to external systems (e.g., frontend, third-party integrations).

4. **Infrastructure & Frameworks (External Layer)**
   - Handles database persistence, authentication, logging, and external APIs.
   - Uses Django ORM or SQLAlchemy for data management.

## 2. System Components

### 2.1 Domain Layer (Entities)
- Defines core business objects (`Patient`, `Doctor`, `Appointment`, etc.).
- Enforces domain logic within entity methods.

### 2.2 Application Layer (Use Cases)
- Implements business rules through services (e.g., `ScheduleAppointmentService`).
- Calls repositories for data persistence.

### 2.3 Interface Adapters Layer
- Exposes REST APIs through Django REST Framework (or Flask API routes).
- Implements controllers and serializers to handle input/output.

### 2.4 Infrastructure Layer
- Implements database repositories (PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite).
- Handles authentication (JWT-based or OAuth2).
- Manages logging and monitoring services.

### 3.2 Use Case Diagram
- Represents interactions between users (doctors, nurses, administrators) and system functionalities.

### 3.3 Database Schema Diagram
- Defines relationships between tables (Patients, Appointments, Users, etc.).

## 4. Security Considerations
- **Authentication & Authorization:** Role-based access control (RBAC) using JWT or OAuth2.
- **Data Encryption:** Use SSL/TLS for secure data transmission.
- **Backup Strategy:** Regular database backups to prevent data loss.

---

## 5. Next Steps

- Implement core domain models using DDD principles.
- Develop initial use cases and services.
- Begin implementation of the backend API.
- Proceed to the next phase: [Initial Documentation](./06_initial_documentation.md).
