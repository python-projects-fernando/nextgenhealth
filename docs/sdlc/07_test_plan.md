# 7. Test Plan for NextGenHealth

This document defines the testing strategy, objectives, scope, approach, and deliverables for the NextGenHealth healthcare management system. It ensures that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements before release.

## 7.1 Executive Summary

The testing strategy for NextGenHealth follows an Agile, risk-based approach integrated into each development sprint. Testing covers all layers of the application with emphasis on security, compliance (HIPAA/GDPR), and role-based workflows.

> ðŸ”¹ **Update**: The system has been restructured around a **User Management** domain to support multiple roles (Patient, Nurse, Doctor, Administrator), ensuring consistent testing across authentication, authorization, and auditability.

**Testing Duration**: 12 weeks (embedded in sprints)  
**Primary Focus**: Security, data integrity, compliance, usability  
**Test Coverage Goal**: >90% for critical modules  
**Success Criteria**: Zero critical bugs at UAT sign-off

## 7.2 Objectives

- Verify that all functional requirements from [Requirements Gathering](./02_requirements_gathering.md) are implemented correctly
- Ensure non-functional requirements (performance, security, reliability) are met
- Validate role-based access control (RBAC) for all user types
- Confirm compliance with HIPAA and GDPR regulations
- Identify and resolve defects early in the development cycle
- Ensure system stability under expected load conditions
- Provide confidence in production readiness

## 7.3 Scope

### 7.3.1 In Scope

#### Functional Testing
- **User Management**
  - User registration (all roles: Patient, Nurse, Doctor, Administrator)
  - Authentication (login, password reset, account lockout)
  - Profile management and search
  - Role-based permissions enforcement

- **Appointment Scheduling**
  - Availability checks and real-time slot display
  - Appointment booking, rescheduling, cancellation
  - Prevention of double-booking and overlapping appointments
  - Self-service booking by patients; proxy booking by nurses/admins

- **Electronic Medical Records (EMR)**
  - Creation, viewing, and updating of medical records
  - Prescription generation and digital signing
  - File upload and secure access (PDF, images)

- **Reporting & Analytics**
  - Generation of appointment, patient, and system reports
  - Data export to PDF and Excel formats
  - Dashboard visibility based on user role

#### Non-Functional Testing
- **Security Testing**: Penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, RBAC validation
- **Performance Testing**: Load testing up to 1,000 concurrent users
- **Usability Testing**: Task completion rate, error recovery, accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- **Compliance Testing**: Audit logging, data encryption, retention policies
- **Reliability Testing**: Failover, backup/restore, graceful degradation

#### Integration Testing
- Email notifications (SendGrid/AWS SES)
- SMS reminders (Twilio/AWS SNS)
- File storage (AWS S3)
- External API integrations (future-proofing)

### 7.3.2 Out of Scope

- Mobile application testing (system is web-based only)
- AI-driven diagnostic features
- Integration with external healthcare systems (e.g., laboratories, pharmacies) â€” future phase
- Multi-clinic deployment testing â€” future consideration
- Advanced FHIR interoperability â€” future enhancement

## 7.4 Testing Approach

Testing will follow the Agile Scrum methodology with testing embedded in each sprint. A shift-left approach ensures early defect detection.

| Phase | Duration | Testing Focus |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| Sprint 1â€“3 | Weeks 1â€“6 | Unit & integration testing for authentication and **User Management** |
| Sprint 4â€“6 | Weeks 7â€“12 | Appointment scheduling & notifications |
| Sprint 7â€“8 | Weeks 13â€“16 | EMR and file uploads |
| Sprint 9â€“10 | Weeks 17â€“20 | Reporting & analytics |
| Sprint 11 | Weeks 21â€“22 | Performance & security testing |
| Sprint 12 | Weeks 23â€“24 | User Acceptance Testing (UAT) & final regression |

### 7.4.1 Testing Levels

#### Unit Testing
- **Tools**: PyTest, unittest.mock
- **Coverage**: Minimum 90% for core modules
- **Focus**: Use cases, domain services, value objects

#### Integration Testing
- **Tools**: Django TestCase / Flask Test Client
- **Coverage**: All service interactions (e.g., UseCase â†’ Repository)
- **Focus**: Database persistence, external service calls

#### System Testing
- **Manual & Automated**: Selenium, Playwright
- **Scenarios**: End-to-end user journeys per role
- **Data**: Anonymized production-like datasets

#### User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
- **Participants**: Healthcare providers (doctors, nurses), administrators, patients
- **Environment**: Staging with production-like data
- **Validation**: Business process alignment, usability, workflow efficiency

#### Compliance & Security Testing
- **Penetration Testing**: External security firm
- **Audit Validation**: All sensitive actions must be logged
- **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest and in transit verified

## 7.5 Test Environment

| Component | Configuration |
|---------|---------------|
| **Backend** | Python 3.11+, Django/Flask |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL 15 (staging copy) |
| **Caching** | Redis 7.0 |
| **Frontend** | HTMX + Bootstrap 5 |
| **External Services** | Mocked (via responses/stubber) or sandbox (SendGrid, Twilio) |
| **Monitoring** | Sentry, New Relic (staging) |
| **Deployment** | Docker Compose for local, Railway/Render for staging |

## 7.6 Test Data Strategy

- **Anonymized Production Data**: Used for UAT and performance testing
- **Synthetic Data**: Generated for edge cases and boundary testing
- **Role-Specific Users**: Pre-configured accounts for each role
- **Data Isolation**: No real PII in development environments
- **Backup & Reset**: Daily refresh of test database

## 7.7 Defect Management

- **Tool**: GitHub Issues or Jira
- **Severity Levels**:
  - Critical (blocker): System crash, data loss, security breach
  - High: Major functionality broken
  - Medium: Usability issue, minor bug
  - Low: Cosmetic improvement
- **Resolution SLA**:
  - Critical: <4 hours
  - High: <24 hours
  - Medium: <5 days
  - Low: Next sprint

## 7.8 Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| Incomplete Requirements | High | Medium | Continuous backlog refinement |
| Test Environment Instability | Medium | Medium | Early environment setup and monitoring |
| Insufficient Test Data | Medium | Medium | Prepare anonymized data early |
| Regulatory Compliance Failure | High | Low | Early compliance reviews and audits |
| Performance Bottlenecks | Medium | Medium | Load testing during development |

## 7.9 Deliverables

- âœ… Test plan documentation
- âœ… Test cases and scripts
