# 7. Test Plan for NextGenHealth

This document defines the **testing strategy, objectives, scope, approach, and deliverables** for the **NextGenHealth** healthcare management system.  
It ensures that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements before release.

---

## 7.1 Introduction

The purpose of this Test Plan is to describe the **scope**, **approach**, **resources**, and **schedule** of the testing activities for the NextGenHealth system.  
It aims to ensure that the system:
- Meets the specifications described in the requirements documents.
- Is free of critical defects.
- Is compliant with healthcare regulations (HIPAA, GDPR, local laws).

---

## 7.2 Test Objectives

The objectives of testing are to:
1. Verify that all functional requirements are implemented correctly.
2. Validate that the system meets performance, security, and usability expectations.
3. Identify and resolve defects before production deployment.
4. Ensure that all critical workflows operate without failures.
5. Confirm compliance with regulatory and privacy requirements.

## 7.3 Scope of Testing

### 7.3.1 In Scope
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - Patient registration, profile management, and search.
  - Appointment scheduling, conflict prevention, notifications.
  - EMR creation, prescription management, exam file upload.
  - Reporting and statistics generation.
  - Authentication, authorization, and RBAC.
- **Non-Functional Requirements**:
  - Performance (response time, concurrency).
  - Security (authentication, encryption, access control).
  - Usability and accessibility.
  - Reliability (uptime, recovery).
  - Interoperability (API compliance).

### 7.3.2 Out of Scope
- External system integrations not included in the current release (e.g., laboratory, pharmacy).
- Mobile application testing (system is web-based only).
- AI-driven diagnostic features (not in scope for MVP).

---

## 7.4 Testing Approach

Testing will follow the **Agile Scrum methodology** with testing embedded in each sprint.  
Testing will include **manual** and **automated** verification where applicable.

### 7.4.1 Test Levels
1. **Unit Testing**  
   - Tests individual components and modules.
   - Performed by developers during implementation.
2. **Integration Testing**  
   - Validates interaction between modules (e.g., Patient â†’ Appointment).
   - Performed after module completion.
3. **System Testing**  
   - End-to-end validation of the system against requirements.
4. **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**  
   - Conducted with healthcare providers and admin staff.
   - Focus on usability, workflows, and business process validation.

### 7.4.2 Test Types
- **Functional Testing** (feature verification).
- **Performance Testing** (load, stress, scalability).
- **Security Testing** (penetration, vulnerability scans).
- **Usability Testing** (UI/UX compliance, accessibility checks).
- **Compatibility Testing** (browsers, devices).
- **Compliance Testing** (HIPAA, GDPR).

---

## 7.5 Test Deliverables

- **Test Cases** (mapped to requirements).
- **Test Data** (anonymized for compliance).
- **Test Execution Reports**.
- **Defect Reports** (with severity and priority).
- **UAT Sign-off Document**.
- **Final Test Summary Report**.

---

## 7.6 Entry and Exit Criteria

### 7.6.1 Entry Criteria
- Requirements are approved and baselined.
- System architecture and detailed design are completed.
- Development environment is stable.
- Unit tests for completed modules have passed.

### 7.6.2 Exit Criteria
- All planned test cases executed.
- All critical and high-severity defects resolved.
- Performance, security, and compliance criteria met.
- UAT sign-off obtained from stakeholders.

---

## 7.7 Test Environment

- **Environment**:
  - Staging server mirroring production configuration.
- **Database**:
  - PostgreSQL with anonymized test data.
- **Tools**:
  - Test management tool (e.g., TestRail, Zephyr).
  - Bug tracking (e.g., Jira).
  - Performance testing (e.g., Locust).
  - Security testing (e.g., OWASP ZAP).
- **Browsers Supported**:
  - Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari (latest stable versions).
- **Devices Supported**:
  - Desktop (full), Tablet (full), Mobile (view-only critical features).

## 7.8 Risk and Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Incomplete requirements | High | Continuous backlog refinement |
| Test environment instability | Medium | Early environment setup |
| Insufficient test data | Medium | Prepare anonymized data early |
| Regulatory compliance failure | High | Early compliance reviews |
| Performance bottlenecks | Medium | Load testing during development |

---

## 7.9 Test Schedule

Testing will follow the development sprints, with the following high-level allocation:

| Phase | Duration | Testing Focus |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| Sprint 1-3 | Weeks 1-6 | Unit & integration testing for authentication and patient management |
| Sprint 4-6 | Weeks 7-12 | Appointment scheduling & notifications |
| Sprint 7-8 | Weeks 13-16 | EMR and file uploads |
| Sprint 9-10 | Weeks 17-20 | Reporting & analytics |
| Sprint 11 | Weeks 21-22 | Performance & security testing |
| Sprint 12 | Weeks 23-24 | UAT & final regression |

---

## 7.10 Approval

This Test Plan requires approval from:
- **Project Manager**
- **Product Owner**
- **Lead Developer**
- **QA Lead**
- **Compliance Officer**
