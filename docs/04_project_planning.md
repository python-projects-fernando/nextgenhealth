## 2. Project Timeline

The project will be divided into multiple phases to ensure systematic development and testing.

### Proposed Phases:
1. **Phase 1 - Patient Registration (2 weeks)**
   - Develop patient registration functionality.
   - Validate input data and store information securely.

2. **Phase 2 - Appointment Scheduling (3 weeks)**
   - Implement scheduling interface.
   - Validate time conflicts.
   - Associate appointments with patients and doctors.

3. **Phase 3 - Electronic Medical Records (4 weeks)**
   - Enable doctors to create and update medical records.
   - Implement secure storage for patient history.

4. **Phase 4 - Authentication and Access Control (3 weeks)**
   - Implement login/logout functionality.
   - Define and enforce user roles (e.g., doctor, administrator, nurse).

5. **Phase 5 - Reporting and Statistics (3 weeks)**
   - Generate reports for completed appointments, exams, and patient statistics.
   
6. **Final Phase - Testing and Deployment (4 weeks)**
   - Conduct unit tests and integration tests.
   - Deploy the system to a production environment.

## 3. Development Methodology

To manage tasks efficiently, an agile methodology will be adopted.

### Key Approaches:
- **Scrum or Kanban:**
  - Define sprints (2-week cycles) with clear deliverables.
  - Maintain a backlog of tasks and prioritize them.
  
- **Code Reviews & Collaboration:**
  - Regular code reviews to ensure quality.
  - Utilize GitHub/Azure DevOps for tracking issues and progress.

- **Continuous Integration & Testing:**
  - Implement automated tests for key functionalities.
  - Ensure continuous integration using GitHub Actions or another CI/CD tool.

## 4. Next Steps

- Begin setting up the development environment.
- Define detailed system architecture.
- Start with the implementation of **Phase 1 - Patient Registration**.

Proceed to the next phase: [System Architecture Design](./05_system_architecture.md).
