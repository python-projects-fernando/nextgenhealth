feat(patient): implement full PatientProfile registration flow with DDD and Clean Architecture

- Added PatientProfile entity with strict domain validation (emergency contact, insurance, medical history, etc.)
- Implemented RegisterPatientProfileUseCase with command pattern and async repository
- Created PostgreSQL infrastructure: PatientProfileModel, PostgresPatientProfileRepository
- Integrated FastAPI route /patient with dependency injection and error handling
- Added patient_profile_factory for consistent test data
- Extended base models and updated dependencies for dual-repository support (User + PatientProfile)
- Aligned with HIPAA-ready audit fields (created_at, updated_at) and UTC timezone enforcement

Enables complete user registration flow: User â†’ PatientProfile in a single transactional boundary.
