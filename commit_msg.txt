feat(domain): implement User entity with TDD and DDD

- Implemented User aggregate root with validation for uuid, email, name, and phone (E.164)
- Applied TDD: unit tests for all invalid/valid cases using pytest
- Used create_valid_user factory to reduce duplication in tests
- Fail-fast validation via domain-specific exceptions
- Full Google-style docstrings for Sphinx documentation
- Integrated Modelio UML diagrams into docs/uml/
- Aligned with Clean Architecture and HIPAA/GDPR readiness

Solid foundation for identity management in healthcare.
