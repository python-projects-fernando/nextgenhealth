fix(ci): correct test workflow to support multiple unit tests

- Updated test.yml to properly install the package in editable mode with 'pip install -e .'
- Ensured all unit tests are discovered and executed by make test
- Fixed missing dependency installation that caused import errors in CI
- Maintains compatibility with src/ layout and absolute imports

Now runs all user validation tests (UUID, email, name, phone) on every push/pull request.
